We visualize the data, and use different supervised learning classification techniques (logistic regression, KNN, random forests) to predict heart disease in patients. We also compare the performance of these techniques on different evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

The dataset which has been downloaded from The UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) and converted to a CSV file.
